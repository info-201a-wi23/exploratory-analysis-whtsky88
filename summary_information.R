# In summary of all the total technology company layoffs, we found that there
# are `477` number of companies reported in the total dataset. Adding them all
# together, we found that there are a total of `13156` people that are laid off.
# Given such information, we dug deeper into the dataset and found out that
# `Amazon` company has been affected the most and had the greatest number of
# layoffs with a total of `18000` people. Most companyâ€™s headquarter are located
# at `San Francisco`. To sum up all the given values, the top layoff industry is
# `fintech`. From all the companies listed in this dataset, `75.7`% of them are
# identified as private, indicating that most laid off companies are private
# companies, who took the larger burden.
